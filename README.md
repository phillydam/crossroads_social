-Crossroads Social is a platform meant to bring individuals together based on their general locations and interests.
-The app includes full CRUD with multiple variations of creating and updating methods. 
-The app fully uses Mongoose, Express and I chose to use EJS for my Front End
-It also has the MVP requirement of 5 RESTful routes and the MVC full directory.
-I also used Bootstrap as my CSS template.

-The main goal of this app was to give users the oppurtunity to create their own personalized profiles and which includes bios and photos they chose to upload.
-Each profile also includes a Comment Stream that other users as well has the profile's owner and comment and communicate on.


A stretch goal of mine was to include a Google maps API that would show the general area of each user and use this to connect users together.
